# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
In this project, I made an API call to get earthquake data and create several maps based off of different features. Ultimately, I created a map that had 3 unique styles, and 3 overlays including one to show all earthquakes, one to show major earthquakes, and one to show the tectonic plates.
